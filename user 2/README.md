Code Refactor

Our task for this assignment was to refactor this existing webpage's code to make it more accesible.  The goal was to improve their codebase for long term sustainability. My job was to ensure that all links are functioning correctly and clean up the CSS to make it more efficient, consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
